    <h2>Star Wars</h2>
    <p>It is a period of civil wars in the galaxy. A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has challenged the tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE.</p>
    <p>Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, rebel spaceships have won their first victory in a battle with the powerful Imperial Starfleet.</p>
    <p>The EMPIRE fears that another defeat could bring a thousand more solar systems into the rebellion, and Imperial control over the galaxy would be lost forever.</p>
    <p>To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new battle station. Powerful enough to destroy and entire planet, its completion spells certain doom for the champions of freedom.</p>
